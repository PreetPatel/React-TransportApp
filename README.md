# Auckland Stops
## A React & TypeScript Project

![Main Screen](https://github.com/PreetPatel/React-TransportApp/blob/master/Main.PNG)
Searching for buses only works for Auckland Addresses for now. You can start typing an address and using autocomplete, the app will show you addresses matching the typed words.

You can search for an address and the website will show the bus stops nearest to a radius of 200m

Bus services are pulled from the Auckland Transport API and show all lines operating in that location. Future features such as real time tracking are coming soon.
